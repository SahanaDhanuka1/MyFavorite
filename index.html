    <section id="aboutwriting">
        <p> One of my favorite things to do in my spare time is write. I have a vivid imagination, therefore I love to pen down my thoughts. I get most of the inspiration for what I write from stories that I read, and everyday life. I am currently writing a crossover story with two of my favorite characters, Percy Jackson and Harry Potter, where I use the basic essence of both the books, but add my own touch to it. I am alos working on one with my sister, and another individually. This hobby is a good source of enjoyment, and inspiration. It makes us disciplined, improves our vocabulary, and overall helps us throughout our lives. </p>
